# Task Manager Application

## Overview
This is a simple Task Management application built as part of an assignment to evaluate learning ability, problem-solving approach, and execution.

The app allows users to create tasks, view all tasks, and update task status from Todo to In Progress to Done.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Data Storage: In-memory array

## Features
- Create a new task with title and description
- View all tasks
- Update task status
- Loading and error handling (learned during this assignment)

## Learning Outcome
I learned how to handle loading states and error scenarios while making API calls using the Fetch API. This helped improve user experience and made the application more robust.

## Challenges
- Initially faced issues with folder structure and server setup
- Resolved by understanding how Node resolves file paths and organizing the backend separately

## Improvements
- Add database support
- Improve UI design
- Add authentication

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the backend folder
2. Run `node server.js`
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in the browser
